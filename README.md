Codepath Practice Exercise
Hours: 17

This is an iOS application for calculting the tip and full amount you need to pay. Unlike other tip applications, this tip application assumes that you do not want to tip on the taxes that you've paid.


REQUIRED STORIES
* [x] User can enter a subtotal from the bill and see the amount that they need to tip and the full amount of the bill.
* [x] User can change the percentage they want to tip and see that change reflected in the tip and full amount.

OPTIONAL STORIES
* [x] User enters total (including taxes) from a credit card slip and the tip and full amount are calculated based on the bill BEFORE taxes. This prevents the user from tipping on taxes.
* [x] User can toggle whether or not the SF Healthy taxes are included in the total amount.
* [x] Nicer user experiecnce on startup where all the extra information is stripped away and user just types amount.
* [x] Information and controls fade in once user starts typing.
* [x] add an app icon
* [x] added a descriptive launch screen
